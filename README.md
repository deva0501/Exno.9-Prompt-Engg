# Ex. No. 9 – Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Video Generation  

**Date:** 08/10/25


**Reg. No.:** 212223060043

## Aim  
To demonstrate the ability of text-to-video generation tools to reproduce an existing video by crafting precise prompts, and to identify key elements within the video to generate a result as close as possible to the original.  

---

## Procedure  

1. **Analyze the Original Video**  
   - Identify and note the following key elements:  
     - **Objects/Subjects**: (e.g., people, landscapes, animals, objects)  
     - **Colors**: Dominant hues and contrasts  
     - **Textures**: Smooth, rough, glossy, soft  
     - **Lighting**: Bright, dim, natural, artificial  
     - **Background**: Indoor/outdoor, detailed/simple  
     - **Composition**: Focal points, depth, perspective  
     - **Style**: Realistic, artistic, cartoonish, cinematic  

2. **Create the Basic Prompt**  
   - Write a simple description of the video (e.g., *“A serene landscape with mountains and a river”*).  

3. **Refine the Prompt with More Detail**  
   - Add specific attributes such as color, time of day, mood, and environment (e.g., *“A serene sunset landscape with purple mountains and a calm reflective river”*).  

4. **Identify Style and Artistic Influences**  
   - Specify whether the video should be realistic, cinematic, cartoonish, or painterly (e.g., *“in the style of a cinematic wide-angle shot with natural lighting”*).  

5. **Adjust and Fine-tune**  
   - Add textures, weather conditions, or extra details (e.g., *“soft pastel clouds, light wind ripples on the river surface”*).  

6. **Generate the Video**  
   - Use the crafted prompt in a text-to-video generation tool such as:  
     - **DALL·E** (by OpenAI)  
     - **Stable Diffusion**  
     - **MidJourney**  

7. **Compare with the Original Video**  
   - Assess how closely the generated video matches in terms of:  
     - Objects and subjects  
     - Colors and lighting  
     - Style and composition  
   - Refine the prompt further if necessary.

## Tools / Models Used  

- **DALL·E** – Text-to-video/image generation tool by OpenAI.  
- **Stable Diffusion** – Open-source text-to-image/video model with customization.  
- **MidJourney** – AI tool for creative and artistic generations.

## Deliverables  

### 1. Original Video  
A short clip of a **sunset landscape** showing purple mountains, a calm reflective river, and trees along the riverbank. The sky transitions from orange to pink with soft clouds.

### 3. Prompts Used  

- **Basic Prompt:**
  ```text
  A landscape with mountains and a river.
  ```
  -**Refined Prompt:**
  ```TEXT
  A serene landscape during sunset with purple mountains, a calm reflective river, and trees along the shore.
  ```


### 4. Comparison Report  

| Aspect                  | Original Video | Generated Video | Notes / Improvements |
|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| **Subjects**             | Mountains, river, trees | Mountains, river, trees | Matches well |
| **Colors**               | Natural sunset hues (orange, pink, purple) | Slightly more saturated orange, pink, purple | Adjust color intensity for realism |
| **River Reflection**     | Smooth reflection of sunset sky | Reflection reproduced effectively | Very close match |
| **Tree Density**         | Moderate, more trees visible | Fewer trees along the bank | Add details: “dense forest on the left bank” |
| **Clouds**               | Natural soft clouds | Different cloud shapes and motion | Refine with prompt: “soft pastel clouds” |
| **Mood/Style**           | Realistic cinematic | More vivid, slightly dreamy | Adjust mood (dreamy vs realistic) |
| **Camera Perspective**   | Wide-angle valley view | Not explicitly controlled | Add prompt: “wide-angle shot from valley viewpoint” |



## Conclusion:


By using detailed and well-crafted prompts, text-to-Video generation models can be effective in reproducing an Video closely. The quality of the generated Video depends on how accurately the prompt describes the Video's key elements. The experiment demonstrates the importance of prompt refinement and iteration when working with AI tools to achieve desired outcomes. With practice, the model can generate Videos that closely match real-world visuals, which is useful for creative and practical applications.
